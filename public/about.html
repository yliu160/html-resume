      My name is Leo Liu. I graduated from California State University, Los
      Angeles with a major in Computer Science in May 2025. I chose this major
      because I want to learn how to create beautiful websites. My hobbies
      include playing computer games, watching comedy movies and anime, and
      listening to music in my free time. Although I’ve already graduated, I’m
      still working hard to improve my web development skills. My passion for
      this field encourages me whenever I feel discouraged. I want to keep going
      until I reach my goals and build a better future.
